# Build CUDA Neural Network From Scratch

This project is a CUDA-based neural network implementation, developed from scratch with performance optimizations and modifications. The project is inspired by [cuda-neural-network](https://github.com/pwlnk/cuda-neural-network) and has been extended with additional features and optimizations to improve performance. Notably, the input dataset has been changed to MNIST, a popular dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

## Features

- Fully implemented neural network in CUDA for high-performance computations.
- Optimized CUDA kernels for enhanced performance.
- MNIST dataset integration for training and testing the neural network.
- Customizable network architecture to experiment with different configurations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **CUDA**: Ensure that you have CUDA installed on your system. You can download it from [NVIDIA's website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
- **CMake**: Required for building the project.
- **A modern C++ compiler**: GCC or Clang is recommended.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Build-CUDA-Neural-Network-From-Scratch.git
   cd Build-CUDA-Neural-Network-From-Scratch
   ```

2. Build the project using CMake:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   ./your_executable_name
   ```

## Usage

To train the neural network on the MNIST dataset, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
./your_executable_name --train --dataset path/to/mnist
```

You can also test the network with:

```bash
./your_executable_name --test --dataset path/to/mnist
```

Replace `path/to/mnist` with the actual path to your MNIST dataset.

### Example

Here is an example of how to train and test the network:

```bash
./your_executable_name --train --dataset ./data/mnist
./your_executable_name --test --dataset ./data/mnist
```
